# Zsh

Zsh is a Unix shell which is more customizable than bash.

To get up and ready quickly with zsh, I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and specify my personal theme in `custom/themes/nsgrantham.theme`. 
Among several helpful zsh plugins given in `.zshrc`, my favorite is [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/) which highlights valid commands in green (invalid in red) and underlines valid file paths.
