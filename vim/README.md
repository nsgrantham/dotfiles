# Vim

Vim is my text editor of choice. 

To manage vim plugins, I prefer [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), which I find much easier to use than [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) and [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
Everything necessary for vim-plug to work is given in `.vim/autoload/plug.vim`. The vim-plug section of `.vimrc` lists plugins with `Plug` commands which can be installed in vim with `:PlugInstall!`.
