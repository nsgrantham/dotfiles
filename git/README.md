# Git

`.gitconfig` configures git for your personal use. If you use this file, **make sure to change
user.name, user.email, and github.user!** Further settings change the terminal colors 
for several git subcommands and provide several useful aliases, such as `git unstage` 
which removes all files from staging, and `git graph` and `git graph2` which visualize 
the full commit history of your repo across all branches.

`.gitignore_global` excludes files from version control that are specific to 
operating systems and text editors, taken from [https://github.com/github/gitignore/Global](https://github.com/github/gitignore/Global).
