# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are plain text files that configure the settings of programs in Unix/Linux systems, such as macOS, Ubuntu, etc. They tend to live in a user's home directory and are named with a leading `.` to keep them hidden from the file system (hence the name *dot*files).

This collection of dotfiles is designed to improve my workflow as a statistician / data scientist who specializes in scientific computing, visualization, and reproducible research. Your mileage may vary.
